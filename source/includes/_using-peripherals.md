#Using Peripherals

PocketC.H.I.P. input and output ports are all handled by C.H.I.P.. Chances are good that if a peripheral works with C.H.I.P., it will work with PocketC.H.I.P..

## Audio

To input or output audio from PocketC.H.I.P. use the TRRS jack on C.H.I.P.. 


## USB
There are two different USB ports on PocketC.H.I.P.: micro USB and standard USB. 
### Micro USB
Use the micro usb port for charging PocketC.H.I.P. with a 5-volt, 1-amp power supply. 

### Standard USB

Use the standard USB port for attaching whatever sort of USB device you can think of. Be aware that attached USB devices take power to operate. If they are not independently powered, they will reduce the battery life of PocketC.H.I.P. or cause its operation to become sporadic.
