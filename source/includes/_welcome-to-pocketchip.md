# Welcome to Next Thing Co. PocketC.H.I.P. documentation.

Hey! Thanks for checking out PocketC.H.I.P.! You're rad!

PocketC.H.I.P. is a game console, a portable synthesizer, and a Linux field terminal. With a bit of effort, it can become a whole lot more â€“ see PockulusC.H.I.P., PocketC.H.I.P. as a VR headset (http://pockulus.getchip.com/). The point is, PocketC.H.I.P. can be what you want it to be and we're excited to see what you will do..

These are the PocketC.H.I.P. docs. THE DOCS WILL help you get started with PocketC.H.I.P.. We'll introduce the software that comes pre-installed, explain how to install more,, and hopefully plant some ideas about how you can do even more with your PocketC.H.I.P.

THE DOCS WILL NOT teach you how to code (though it will give tips), how to program a game (though it will explain the tools), how to make music (though it will describe options), or how to build onto PocketC.H.I.P. (though it will encourage it).

Have fun!

# Quick Start
This section explains how to turn on, setup WiFi, and charge PocketC.H.I.P.. 

![Step 1](images/image_1.png)

Turn on PocketC.H.I.P. by pressing down the Home/Power button at the bottom, middle of the keyboard, for about 2 seconds.

PocketC.H.I.P. will take a moment to fully load, but while it does you will see the C.H.I.P. logo a progress bar in the bottom corner of the screen and then a PocketC.H.I.P. splash screen. 

Once PocketC.H.I.P.  is ready you will see a series of slides showing the PocketC.H.I.P. basics. Use the right arrow key or click the right side of the screen to advance forward in the slideshow.

Once you have clicked through the basics, you will see a screen with six icons. This is the HOME screen.

Use a finger or stylus (or really anything that's solid and isn't sharp) to tap on the application you want to use. Press gently enough to make contact with the screen. There's no need to apply a lot of force. A gentle touch will do.

While using  an application, press the HOME/Power button to return to the HOME screen.

### WiFi Setup

From the HOME screen, tap the settings icon in the bottom right corner to access the Settings screen. 

Press the button to the right of the WiFi switch to open a menu of all the networks in range. Scroll through the list and select your network. If needed, slide your finger up and down on the list to scroll. To refresh the network list, just exit the list and enter again. 

When prompted, enter the network password in the text field, then touch the [Connect] button. It may take a few seconds to connect.

### Charging

Plug PocketC.H.I.P. into a 5-volt 1A power supply with a USB-micro cable to charge the 3.7V battery. PocketC.H.I.P. will turn on as soon as you connect the power, but this also consumes power. For faster charging, turn PocketC.H.I.P off and leave it plugged in.

Because it's C.H.I.P.'s on-board circuitry that manages the charging of PocketC.H.I.P.'s battery, the C.H.I.P. must remain attached to PocketC.H.I.P. for battery charging.

PocketC.H.I.P. is compatible with most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable.

### Troubleshooting

If PocketC.H.I.P. becomes unresponsive, hold down the Home/Power button for 8 seconds. This will cut power to PocketC.H.I.P., and immediately shut it down. Only use this shutdown method if no other shutdown methods work.
