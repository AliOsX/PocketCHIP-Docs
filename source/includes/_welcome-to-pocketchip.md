## Welcome to Next Thing Co. PocketC.H.I.P. documentation.

When we made C.H.I.P., the $9 computer, many people thought it came with a screen and keyboard. At the time it did not, but it made us think, what if we did build a product with a screen and keyboard that used C.H.I.P.. We did, it’s PocketC.H.I.P..


### Quick Start
This section explains how to turn on and charge PocketC.H.I.P., plus a quick WiFi setup guide. It’s meant to get you using PocketC.H.I.P. quickly. There’s of couse a ton more you can do with PocketC.H.I.P., but look to other sections for more in-depth coverage.

Turn on PocketC.H.I.P. by holding down the Home/Power button, located at the bottom, middle of the keyboard, for TKTK seconds. 

Your PocketC.H.I.P. takes a moment to fully start and while it does, you will see a TKTK. Once it is done fully loading, you will see a 3x2 grid of icons. This is the HOME screen.

Use your finger or a stylus to tap on the application you want to use. Tap the down arrow at the bottom center of the screen to see more applications. For more on specific applications, see the apps section.

When you’re done using an application, press the HOME button and you will return to the HOME screen.

### WiFi Setup

From the HOME screen, tap the WiFi icon in the top left corner to access the Settings screen. Then slide the toggle next to the WiFi icon to the right to turn the wifi on. Tap the button to the right of the toggle to select your network.

Slide your finger up and down on the list and tap on the network you want to join.

Enter in your network password in the text area, then touch the [Connect] button. It may take a few seconds to connect.

#### Troubleshooting

If for any reason PocketC.H.I.P. does not respond to your input, hold down the Home button for 8 seconds. This will terminate the battery power to PocketC.H.I.P. causing a hard-shutdown. Only use this shutdown method if all other shutdown methods do not work.
