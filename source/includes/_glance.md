IMAGE OF KEYBOARD LAYOUT

PocketC.H.I.P. has a full QWERTY keyboard with comfortably located arrow keys for gaming. 

TK

Each button is labeled with pink text. This signifies the default button behavior. Some buttons have two rows of pink text stacked atop each other. The bottom label is the primary behavior of the key. The top label identifies the button’s secondary behavior, which is accessible by holding down SHIFT and pressing the button. 

For example: SHIFT+1 prints ! 

An even smaller number of  buttons are labeled to the top-left with white text on a pink background. Examples are the function keys (F1, F2,...F11) and lesser used punctuation marks. To type them, hold down FN key and press the desired button.

For example: FN+J prints >

##Pencil stand
Give your hands a break! You can prop PocketC.H.I.P. up on a table with a pencil or pen. Pencils go in the right-hand-side pencil hole, and pens in the left hole. You only need one.

##Removable enclosure
To fully disassemble PocketC.H.I.P., first remove the bezel (frame) around the perimeter of the screen. Make sure that C.H.I.P. is removed from PocketC.H.I.P.. Remove the back case of PocketC.H.I.P. by pressing the tabs above the screen and on either side of the Home/Power button..

While the case is open, check out the “secret” prototyping area and GPIO solder pads inside the enclosure!

##GPIO Access
Along the top edge of PocketC.H.I.P. are the exposed C.H.I.P. input and output pins. These are great for attaching and controlling sensors, motors, and LEDs. 
See C.H.I.P. documentation to learn how to use them.
