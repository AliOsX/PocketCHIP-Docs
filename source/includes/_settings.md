Use the PocketC.H.I.P. settings to change WiFi, screen brightness, or volume levels. 

## WiFi & Bluetooth

From the HOME screen, tap the settings icon in the bottom right corner to access the Settings screen. Then tap the switch next to the WiFi icon to turn WiFi on. 

Press the button to the right of the WiFi switch to open a menu of all the networks in range. Scroll through the list and select your network. If needed, tap the down arrow to see more networks.


When prompted, enter the network password in the text field, then touch the [Connect] button. It may take a few seconds to connect.

Currently only WiFi is configurable from the PocketC.H.I.P graphical interface. If you want to configure Bluetooth, consult the C.H.I.P. documentation page (docs.getchip.com).

## Screen Brightness

Tap the brightness slider on the left to decrease brightness or tap the right to increase. Lowering the brightness is an easy way to increase battery life.

## Volume

Adjust the volume slider by tapping on the left to decrease volume or on the right to increase it. Of course, you'll need to have headphones or speakers attached to PocketC.H.I.P. to hear anything.
